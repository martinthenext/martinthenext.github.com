      <description>Following this post, I made a decision to disable Disqus comments on this site to prevent tracking. The amount of tracking networks Disqus hooks up to their comment widget is crazy. I would like to keep both my personal website and this blog as cookie-free as possible.
I also decided to not substitute the comment section with the Github hack, like the original post suggests. The reason is that, in my opinion, in parts of the internet I care about, productive discussions rarely happen in the immidiate place where the content was posted.</description>
