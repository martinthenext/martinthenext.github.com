      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;a href=&#34;http://donw.io/post/github-comments/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, I made a decision to disable &lt;a href=&#34;https://disqus.com/&#34;&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt; comments on this site to prevent tracking. The amount of tracking networks Disqus hooks up to their comment is crazy. I would like to keep both my personal website and this blog as cookie-free as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also decided to not substitute the comment section with the Github hack, like the original post suggests. The reason is that, in my opinion, in parts of the internet I care about, productive discussions rarely happen in the immidiate place where the content was posted. The way that Medium and Tubmlr handle comments, as well as the emergence of completely isolated publishing systems like &lt;a href=&#34;http://telegra.ph/&#34;&gt;Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; indicates that places where people write and talk don&amp;rsquo;t have to coincide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or suggestions, I am always happy to talk! Email me at martin davtyan gmail dot com.&lt;/p&gt;
